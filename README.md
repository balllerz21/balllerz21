I've been a maker at heart for as long as I can remember. As a kid, it started with LEGOs (thanks to my parents fueling my love for building), and eventually, I graduated to coding and tech projects in high school. There, I dove into Computer Science and joined a tech-art club where I got to play around with makerspaces—combining creativity with tech in the coolest way.

Fast forward to college, where I landed the SWE Knowles Scholarship and continued to explore the endless world of computer science. I'm still finding my niche, but data analytics, cybersecurity, and software engineering have all caught my eye.

Right now, I’m soaking up as much experience as possible—analyzing data, building projects, and constantly learning. I’m on the lookout for roles where I can dive deeper into these fields, work on exciting challenges, and make a real impact.
